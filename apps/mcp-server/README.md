# Meal Planner MCP Server

This service exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that maps MCP tools to the Meal Planner tRPC API. It is designed to run alongside the existing `meals-api` container and lets MCP clients (including ChatGPT and Claude) read and update weekly plans.

The server includes its own OAuth 2.1 + PKCE authorization server so that clients which only support OAuth (such as ChatGPT custom connectors) can connect without a static bearer token. User authentication is delegated to the existing better-auth setup on the meals web app — the MCP server validates the shared session cookie via the meals API and then issues its own JWT access tokens.

## Configuration

Copy the sample environment file and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:

- `MEALS_API_INTERNAL_ORIGIN` – base URL for the Meal Planner API. Used for both forwarded tRPC calls and for validating better-auth sessions during the OAuth login flow (the MCP server calls `${MEALS_API_INTERNAL_ORIGIN}/auth/get-session`). Default: `http://localhost:4000`.
- `DATABASE_URL` – Postgres connection string. OAuth provider state (registered clients, authorization codes, refresh tokens, consent decisions) is stored here, so connected clients survive restarts and deploys. Point it at the same instance as `meals-api`; the tables are created by the same Prisma migrations.
- `MCP_API_KEY` – shared secret sent as `x-api-key` to the Meal Planner API for service-to-service auth. Must match `MCP_API_KEY` in `apps/server/.env`. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- `MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER` – public origin of this MCP server, e.g. `https://meals-mcp.example.com`. Used as the OAuth issuer in tokens and discovery metadata.
- `MCP_OAUTH_SIGNING_SECRET` – HMAC secret used to sign JWT access tokens. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 64`.
- `MCP_OAUTH_LOGIN_URL` – public URL of the meals web app's login page. Unauthenticated `/oauth/authorize` requests are redirected here with `?callbackUrl=…`.

Optional:

- `MCP_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` – access token lifetime in seconds. Default: `3600` (1 hour).
- `MCP_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL` – refresh token lifetime in seconds. Default: `2592000` (30 days).
- `PORT` – port to expose the MCP server. Default: `5050`.
- `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` – comma-separated list of `Host` headers accepted by the server (DNS rebinding protection).

## OAuth flow overview

The MCP server hosts a complete OAuth 2.1 authorization server with PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration:

| Endpoint                                          | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`     | RFC 8414 metadata (auth + token URLs)    |
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`       | RFC 9728 resource metadata               |
| `POST /oauth/register`                            | RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration     |
| `GET /oauth/authorize`                            | Authorization endpoint (PKCE S256 only)  |
| `POST /oauth/authorize/decision`                  | Consent form submission (approve/deny)   |
| `POST /oauth/token`                               | Token endpoint (`authorization_code`, `refresh_token`) |
| `POST /mcp`                                       | Protected MCP endpoint (`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`) |

When a client hits `/oauth/authorize` without a valid better-auth session cookie, the server redirects to `MCP_OAUTH_LOGIN_URL?callbackUrl=…`. The web app's login page authenticates the user (magic link or OTP via better-auth) and sends them back to `/oauth/authorize`. Because client registration is open (DCR), the server then shows an explicit consent page before issuing an authorization code — otherwise any registered client could obtain a code for a logged-in user via a single crafted link. Approvals are remembered per user + client, so subsequent authorizations for the same client skip the consent screen. Token exchange validates PKCE and returns a JWT access token plus a rotating opaque refresh token.

### State persistence

Registered clients, authorization codes, refresh tokens, and consent decisions live in Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`), not in process memory. That matters for two failure modes that otherwise show up within days:

- A client such as ChatGPT caches the `client_id` it got from Dynamic Client Registration. If the registration is gone after a restart, re-authorizing fails with `invalid_client: Unknown client_id` and the only way out is deleting and re-adding the connector.
- Refresh tokens that vanish on restart log every connected client out, regardless of `MCP_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL`.

Refresh tokens rotate on every use, and the old token keeps working for 60 seconds after rotation. Within that window it returns the *same* replacement token instead of a new one, so a client whose rotation response was lost — or two refreshes racing — recovers instead of losing its session. After the window, reuse is rejected as normal. Expired rows are swept every 15 minutes; registrations that were never connected through are dropped after 24 hours.

For the cookie share to work, better-auth on `meals-api` must be configured with `BETTER_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` set to the parent domain (e.g. `.jenanos.xyz`).

## Connecting from ChatGPT

1. In ChatGPT → "Ny app" → set the URL to `https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp`.
2. Choose **OAuth** as authentication.
3. Use **dynamic client registration** — once ChatGPT discovers `registration_endpoint` in the metadata it can register itself with no manual client_id needed.

ChatGPT will register itself, redirect you to the meals web app to log in, then come back and complete the token exchange.

## Connecting from Claude (or other MCP clients)

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meal-planner": {
      "url": "https://meals-mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "auth": {
        "type": "oauth",
        "metadata_url": "https://meals-mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Clients without OAuth support are no longer accepted — the previous static `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` path has been removed.

## Auth, identity, and which household the tools touch

After OAuth, every MCP tool call carries the authenticated user's identity. The MCP server forwards the user id to `meals-api` via `x-mcp-on-behalf-of` alongside the existing `x-api-key` header. The API resolves the user's household via their `HouseholdMember` rows, exactly the same way the regular tRPC clients do for browser sessions.

This means:

- `planner.*`-backed tools read and write data scoped to the user's active household — `BOOTSTRAP_HOUSEHOLD_NAME` is only used as a tie-breaker when the user is in multiple households.
- `recipe.*` and `ingredient.*` tools are still global (not household-scoped) – any change is visible to every household.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm --filter mcp-server dev
```

For local OAuth testing, set:

```bash
MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER=http://localhost:5050
MCP_OAUTH_LOGIN_URL=http://localhost:3000/login
MCP_OAUTH_SIGNING_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)
```

Note: when both apps run on `localhost`, the cross-subdomain cookie share isn't needed — but you also won't be testing the production cookie path. End-to-end testing of OAuth is best done on real subdomains.

## Build & start

```bash
pnpm --filter mcp-server build
pnpm --filter mcp-server start
```

## Tests

The OAuth provider (PKCE, JWT signing/verification, token stores, and the full authorize → consent → token flow) is covered by vitest:

```bash
pnpm --filter mcp-server test
```
